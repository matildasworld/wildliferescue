        <h2>Kangaroos</h2>
        <img class="home-images" src="~/images/kangaroo.jpeg" />
        Kangaroos are large marsupials that are found only in Australia. 
        They are identified by their muscular tails, strong back legs, large feet, short fur and long, pointed ears. Like all marsupials, a sub-type of mammal, females have pouches that contain mammary glands, where their young live until they are old enough to emerge.
        Kangaroos are in the Macropodidae family, which also includes tree-kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, quokkas and pademelons. When people think of kangaroos, the four species that typically come to mind are in the genus Macropus: the antilopine kangaroo, the red kangaroo, the western gray kangaroo and the eastern gray kangaroo. 
        They are sometimes referred to as the "great kangaroos" because these species are much larger than other kangaroos.

        <h2>Possums</h2>
        <img class="home-images" src="~/images/possums.jpg" />
        There are more than 60 different species of opossum, which are often called possums. The most notable is the Virginia opossum or common opossum—the only marsupial (pouched mammal) found in the United States and Canada.
        A female opossum gives birth to helpless young as tiny as honeybees. 
        abies immediately crawl into the mother's pouch, where they continue to develop. As they get larger, they will go in and out of the pouch and sometimes ride on the mother's back as she hunts for food. 
        Opossums may give birth to as many as 20 babies in a litter, but fewer than half of them survive. Some never even make it as far as the pouch.

        <h2>Sugar Gliders</h2>
        <img class="home-images" src="~/images/sugar-slider.jpg" />
        “Sugar Gliders” are small marsupials in the same general family as a Kangaroo or Koala Bear.
        They are originally from the rainforests of Australia and Indonesia , and have been domestically bred as household pets in the United States for the last 12-15 years.
        They got the name "Sugar Gliders" because they:
        like to eat almost anything that is sweet, especially fresh fruit & vegetables, and
        they have a gliding membrane (similar to a flying squirrel) that stretches from their wrist to their ankles, allowing them to glide - not fly - from tree to tree
        In the wild they primarily live in trees in "colonies" of 10-15 other Gliders. Their "scientific" name: Petaurus Breviceps, and their specific Taxonomic Classification is:

        <h2>Wallabies</h2>
        <img class="home-images" src="~/images/wallabies.jpg" />
        Wallabies are members of the kangaroo clan found primarily in Australia and on nearby islands. 
        There are many wallaby species, grouped roughly by habitat: shrub wallabies, brush wallabies, and rock wallabies. 
        Hare wallabies are named for their size and their hare-like behavior.
        All wallabies are marsupials or pouched mammals. Wallaby young are born tiny, helpless, and undeveloped. 
        They immediately crawl into their mothers' pouches where they continue to develop after birth—usually for a couple of months. 
        Young wallabies, like their larger kangaroo cousins, are called joeys. Even after a joey leaves the pouch, it often returns to jump in when danger approaches.
